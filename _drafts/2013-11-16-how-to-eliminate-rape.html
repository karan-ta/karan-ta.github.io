<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Rape is clearly a very hard problem to solve .<br />Normal solutions suggested by everyone &nbsp;are :<br /><br />1) extreme harsh punishment - torture them and publicize it , social boycott towards the &nbsp;criminals and their families. .<br />2) empower women with pepper sprays , <b>alarms&nbsp;</b><br />3) education can alter perspective of the criminals<br />4) stronger patrolling , supervision by police<br />5) ban politicians , police , remove them [these are mostly rants]<br /><br /><br />I think points 1,4,5 are pretty worthless and ideas of lazy minds .<br /><br />i agree with point 2 and am more in favour of alarms .<br /><br />point 3 could make a difference surely but its too long term and can happen steadily.<br /><br />Let us now try and think about cause for rape<br /><br />1) mind of criminal has lost it and wants to do all possible crimes<br />2) revenge<br />3) anger , rage<br />4) sense of adventure for the criminal<br /><br /><br /></div>
