<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Google adsense.<br />AH.<br /><br />The shining light to a beginner writer.<br />This is the reason i kept my blog on blogger.<br />as i already had 0.23$ in my adsense account :)<br />I could have shifted my blog to github with jekyll<br />or I could have gone the self hosted route as well.<br /><br />But i decided to stick to blogger to save my 0.23$ and possibly grow my adsense account balance.<br /><br />After 2 weeks of this decision - I am happy with blogger so far.<br />It allowed me a custom domain.<br />When i find time - I can modify my theme as well when I find time.<br /><br />But adsense is not making me happy at all so far.<br />The reasons are as below:<br /><br />1) The adsense revenue daily is not consistent with page views.<br /><br />2) I am worried that i am stealing money from other businesses<br />If someone clicks on an ad on my blog and visits the advertiser's business web page - I get paid.<br />But am i ensuring business for that click ?<br />so are businesses loosing money when someone clicks on an ad on my blog by mistake ?<br />This makes me uneasy&nbsp; that i am stealing money from advertisers.<br />I would be happy if I knew that clicks that get an advertiser business are only being charged for.<br /><br /></div>
