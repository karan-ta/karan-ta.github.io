<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Hello friends&nbsp; !<br /><br /><br />Today I am starting a new side project called QuickSubmit.<br /><br />Quicksubmit allows you to submit your business , service , matrimony profile to multiple sites by filling up just one single form .<br /><br />In this way you get more visibility , response for your listing .<br /><br />the responses you get can then help you to decide which premium listings you would prefer to buy .<br /><br />The idea is to help users to easily fill out forms , create profiles from their existing social data and submit to multiple sites .<br />Then based on the responses , analytics we can decide which premium listings will be good to buy .<br /><br />I do not have major expectations from economic standpoint as i assume this will be a quick 1 week side project .<br /><br />Hoping to blog about it and have fun too .&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/03/26/how-to-optimize-your-business-for-local-search-and-social-marketing/<br /><br />http://www.locallytype.com/pages/submit.htm</div>
