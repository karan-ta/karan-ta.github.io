<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">I Attended mumbai tech meet on 18th may held at Direct I .</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">This time there were only python talks from the mumpy google group.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">I had volunteered to give a talk on Introduction to Data Mining with python .&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">I spoke about a code walk through to scrape the election results on the election commission of india website .&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">I had planned to create a simple app to display the top 4 candidiates of each constituency .</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">And then display the summary of news from different news sources for these candidiates .&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">I started coding the night before (at 11 pm ) the event as throughout the week i was occupied with choiceman tasks and also had to do multiple follow ups with our sofa guy to deliver our first sofa in the new apartment we moved into around 4 months back .&nbsp; </span></span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I only managed to create a json with the top 4 candidiates using python till 5 AM .<br />Till about 1 AM i was studying what works MP , MLA are supposed to do and which news sources I should scrape and how i can get the photos of all the top 4 candidiates to display in frontend app .</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Then i started writing a simple frontend and was targeting to complete it </span></span>by 10 am .<br /><br />Suddenly from 5 am things started getting super stuck :)<br />I thought I should avoid flask , django as i just wanted to display data from json in my html file . so i started using simple python web server for this .<br /><br />But I just couldnt get the simple web server to render images .<br />Time went by and suddenly it became 10 am and panic started hitting me :)<br /><br />I decided to use flask but from long time had not bootstrapped a new project so wasted some more time debugging and didnt read the docs .<br /><br />Finally had to give up on the frontend app .<br /><br />I made a list of all the concepts , ideas i had studied earlier&nbsp; and thought i would explain them all at the event .<br /><br />I was super cranky at the talk and the code walk through turned out to be rather mundane :)<br />Better planning , execution and luck for next time .<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
