The prob-<br />lem is that people don’t see them for what they are. Those<br />who become the greatest and go the farthest are highly selec-<br />tive about what they take on. They are clear on where they<br />want to go and recognize that most of what life offers will not<br />get them there. <br /><br /><br />6) “Anything is possible, but not everything is possible”<br />—Tyler Rex<br /><br />7) “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”<br />—James 1:8<br /><br />8) If we have more than three priorities, we have none.<br /><br />9) “The life of every man is a diary in which he means<br />to write one story, and writes another; and his hum-<br />blest hour is when he compares the volume as it is<br />with what he vowed to make it.”<br />—J.M. Barrie<br /><br />10) With every serious leap into your future, there will always<br />be naysayers and skeptics. What people don’t understand, they<br />consider absurd.

The wear and tear on your willpower is de-<br />creased allowing you to direct that energy towards your de-<br />sired destination. Once you cross the point of no return, life<br />becomes simpler and easier.<br /><br />14) Rejection and ridicule are real barriers. To be authentic is<br />to be vulnerable.<br /><br />15) “Good timber does not grow with ease<br />The stronger wind, the stronger trees.<br />The further sky, the greater length.<br />The more the storm, the more the strength.<br />By sun and cold, by rain and snow<br />In trees and men good timbers grow.”<br />—Douglas Malloch<br /><br />16) “Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy<br />bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that<br />your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.”<br />—Doctrine and Covenants 88:124<br /><br />17) Checking your email is simply a database of other people’s agendas.<br /><br />18) “I came to this world with nothing<br />And I leave with nothing but love<br />Everything else is just borrowed”<br />—The Streets Lyrics “Borrowed”<br /><br />19) “We buy things we don’t need to<br />impress people we don’t like.”<br />—Tyler Durden<br /><br />20) “Some who laboriously scale the secular heights find,<br />after all, that they are only squatting atop a small<br />mound of sand! They have worked so hard to get<br />there!”<br />—Neal A. Maxwell<br /><br />&nbsp;21) More money makes good people better and bad people worse.<br /><br />22) We often assume those with minimal worldly<br />possessions or accolades are living below their potential. How-<br />ever, they may often be those people most aligned with light,<br />and thus, most connected to eternity and disconnected from<br />time.<br /><br />23) Where do you really want to<br />be? Can you clearly define it? Can you envision it? Does that<br />vision truly motivate you? Is it what you really want?<br />If so, then the motivation needed to get there will come.<br />Your behavior will change. And you’ll build rapid momentum.<br /><br />24) The journey will become the destination. The very act of mov-<br />ing toward big things that are personally meaningful makes<br />your life worth living<br /><br />25) success <br /><br />26) its not worth it if you have not earned it.<br /><br />27) food is mood<br /><br />28) All is energy.
