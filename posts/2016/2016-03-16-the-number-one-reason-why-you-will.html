<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">There could be many reasons that stop your creativity.<br />but the number one reason is surely <b>self sabotage.</b><br /><br />your brain tricks you into thinking that you are not good enough.<br />Your brain tells you - you don't know.<br />you are weak,limited,not capable.<br />others who have made it have something special.<br /><br /><br />There is a whole system of politicians , schools , teachers , parents , siblings ,society who try and support and encourage self sabotage.<br />the matrix is insecure,scared so it comes up with new ways to encourage self sabotage. <br />The matrix keeps trying to encourage your brain into self sabotage.<br />constantly.<br />Just look around you to see how the matrix is trying its best to trick your brain into thinking you are a limited being.</div>
