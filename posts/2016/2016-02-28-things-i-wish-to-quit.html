<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I dream about being a prolific inventor.<br />There are many things accepted by society which only serve<br />as resistance to my creativity.<br /><br />So today i decide to write down clearly all the activities , rituals i wish to quit:<br /><br />1) Television<br /><br />2) Newspapers<br /><br />3) Casual conversations with people i connect with only occasionally.<br /><br />4)******* .<br /><br />5) Porn.<br /><br />6) Junk food , eating anything just to avoid hunger but will not serve my body.<br /><br />7) Hiring others for work which i wouldnt like to do - This is really hard one.<br /><br />8) Eating meat.`:wq
