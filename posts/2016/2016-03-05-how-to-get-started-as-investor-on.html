<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I love the internet.<br />I think humankind can achieve freedom through the internet.<br />Especially once crypto currencies become mainstream.<br />Ethereum , bitcoin are the ones to watch out for (- Hope bitcoin improves).<br /><br />I like other internet fans have views,vision for the internet in contributing towards all of us becoming superpowers and free.<br /><br />So i decided to get started as an investor in the internet.<br />I have decided to do this through flippa as well as crowdfunding.<br /><br />This post is about how to get started on flippa without wasting much time.<br />Flippa can be a time sucker.<br />You gotta keepin check.<br /><br /><b>The main first rule of starting on flippa is - Don't bid unless you have done your due diligence .</b><br />This is because once you bid and its accepted by the seller, then you cannot cancel your bid.<br />you will then have to compulsarily pay the amount you have bid for.<br /><b></b><br />Heres my 30 minute daily strategy for flippa:<br /><br />1) Daily spend 30 minutes to bid.<br />2) for first bid - ensure its around 600 usd or less.<br />3) ensure the listing/offering fulfills lean canvas. <br />4) ensure the listing/offering makes more than 5 usd currently.<br />5) ensure costs are low.<br />6) request for google analytics access</div>
