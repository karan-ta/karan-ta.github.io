<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Recently I started to build up an investment portfolio.<br />During my research - I found several questions on quora as below :<br />How to invest 10 lakhs/15 lakhs/20 lakhs.<br /><br />This question is not at all easy - especially if you are an aspiring creator/maker/inventor.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.karanahuja.in/2016/03/how-to-get-started-as-investor-on.html"></a>I found one good way to do this.<br />Here goes :<br /><br />The maker is involved constantly with his new current projects.<br />One can purchase a commercial shop in the outskirts of mumbai such as mira road , vasai etc.<br />From this shop , one can offer services that support existing businesses such as education institutions, sme and similar institutions.<br />The services can be based around the new projects, inventions of the maker.<br />One can also setup a maker space around current projects, <br /><br />So the asset will provide income from - real estate appreciation as well as from the services offerred.<br />The income from services offerred will beat the income that could come by just putting up the shop on rent.<br /><br />I saw some great shops in poonam sagar area of mira road.<br />A great real estate agent in mira road is sameer based in sheetal nagar .<br />his office is in a car care shop near balaji studio in sheetal nagar.<br />the name of the office is vishesh real estate.<br />it is located near geeta arcade in sheetal nagar.<br /><br />All the best makers for your investments.<br />Any other ideas - please post in comments and help fellow makers, inventors.<br />I have also written a post on <a href="http://www.karanahuja.in/2016/03/how-to-get-started-as-investor-on.html">how to start investing&nbsp; on flippa.</a></div>
