<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Lot of us have now studied the lean business model by steve blank .<br />It says we need to find a problem , try to solve it and measure the impact of our solution so that we can scale.<br /><br />In a b2b business - if we measure how many copies we are selling to measure impact - it ends up being a false vanity measurement .<br />we need to measure the impact on the end user .<br />so in reality B2B is just B2C .<br />B2B == B2C<br /><br />B2B is just a distribution channel on top of B2C . the distribution channel can be quite powerful surely and help us during scaling but not during measuring problem - solution fit.<br />The impact on end user is true value that needs to be measured.cheers !P.S - I know it only gets harder now :)&nbsp;</div>
