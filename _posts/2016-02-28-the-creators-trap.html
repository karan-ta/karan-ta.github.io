<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The creator has some traps he should always strive to guard against:<br /><br /><b>1) Be a neutral user</b><br />The desire to create makes you a biased user.<br />you tend to dislike everything you use.<br />you ignore solutions just around you.<br />Be a neutral user. Use whatever supports you.<br />One way to do this is to review solutions you use - This keeps you interested<br />in using existing solutions and also satiates your desire to contribute.<br /><br /><b>2) Fulfill your own need</b>s.<br />The desire to contribute can lead you to ignore your own needs.<br />I need to buy a stool for my home but keep ignoring this need as i would love to find the time to make one.<br /><br /><b>3) Don't Overlook collaboration oppurtunities.</b><br />Try to always accept collaboration chances if they fit in.<br />Make sure they are the right opportunities as well.<br /><br /><b>4) Save yourself from isolation.</b><br />This is hard to do.<br />but try and find 30 minutes a day atleast to connect with people who matter.<br />your parents,grandparents,spouse, siblings,nephews are usually not receiving quality attention as you strive to create.<br /><br /><b>5) Unwind just a little bit atleast.</b><br />yoga,martial arts,running are great activities for me. </div>
