Vineet joined me half way and we added photos , videos , wall like facebook , greeting card maker , events rsvp and many more features .</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">They should have launched it but decided to create an enhanced version for 1 more year :)</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">5)<b> [2010] Payroll manager side project&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">This was a dead simple web based payroll manager . I had to leave it half way and could not complete the server side code .</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Lost the code when i shifted to a newer computer :)</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;">Looking forward to add new projects to this list !!!</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Hacker friends - do create your list and share</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">cheers.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
