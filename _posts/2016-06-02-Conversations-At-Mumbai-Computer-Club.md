Anshul mentioned the below points :

* Anshul along with Bilal moderated the meeting amazingly well.(I realized every meeting must have a moderator to make the experience reasonable for each participant.)
* Introduced the idea behind Elxir language to the group. Elixir compiles code into erlang. Elixir has syntax like ruby.
  similar to how scala compiles code for the jvm.
* We all saw the angularjs dashboard built for limo app. It looked neat and was updating in real time. Anshul explained about how crowdsourcing works to build routes for limo app.
* While describing benefits of functional language over imperative, he was of the view that architecture when done right weighs out language choice decisions.
* Looking to try out crystal.
* Mentioned that microsoft is getting more open source now with clx working on linux. Dot net fighting for a comeback.
* Discussed futuristic visions for commute in cities. The world is surely changing to be more environment friendly.
* Explained how one process cannot see the data of another process. This guarantee comes from the OS.
* Dislikes emacs :)
* Impressed by progress made by JS.
* Enjoying coding in Elixir currently as he subscribes to the idea that enjoying the tools we use and being happy with them is important.
* Tough to run haskell in production.
* Fixes next meeting on june 16th at 7 pm.
* Scala adoption is low.

Pritesh mentioned the below points :

* Shared this youtube video to get introduced to functional programming with javascript: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84
* Interested in crystal performance boost.
* He will be organizing mumbai ruby meetup on a weekend.
* Impressed with JS progress.
* He is consulting startups on performance design.
* Julia language performance benchmarks are high.
* Google has started a big setup in hyderabad.Apple too has now setup an office in hyderabad.

Bilal mentioned the below points:

* Impressed with how you can build desktop native apps with electron.Atom is built using electron.
* [philosophy] Keep an open mind to look for all the answers as they are out there.
* Recommends silicon valley sitcom.
* Crystal uses strong types, is like ruby and gives a performance boost.
* Digital ocean data centre is now in bangalore. Will we get higher speed for our hosted apps now ?
* Exciting that limo app is running elixir in production. Probably first in mumbai to do so.
* Functional conf maybe happening in coming september.
* Js could really dominate one day.


Karan mentioned the below points:

* With one week's learning of haskell from LYAH- I tried to line up(guess) reasons behind functional language use for parallelism.
* Because of refrential transparency and freedom from side effects offered by functional language - we can use it to solve concurrency and enable parallel computing.
(I realized i havent clearly understood this yet and need to make examples to prove this.)
* Introduced ethereum, hledger to the group.
* Suggested instant gratification on first use of limo app.
* Explained what a side effect is. Once you say a = 5 in a function, you cannot then say a = 7.
  It will be a compile error. (What are you lying?)
