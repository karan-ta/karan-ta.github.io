<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Hello guys<br /><br />I had an eventful sunday and attended mumpy after mumbai toastmasters .<br />Got to meet cool hackers - dhruv , ankur , martin , vineet , tirtesh , talvinder , gaurav .<br /><br />So lets see what happened at mumpy :<br /><br />First up Dhruv started a session about python basics .<br />He fired up ipython and demo'ed examples to explain python basics .<br />it was kinda similar to google python class but much more interactive , fun and cool jokes thrown in by dhruv .<br />amazing session to revise the basics and focus on few gotchas .<br /><br />To see few gotchas , try to guess the output of below and post your explainations in the comments :<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />l = [1,a,3]<br />l.sort()<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />s = "karan"<br />s1 = s.reverse()<br />print s<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />l = [1,a,c]<br />b = l.sort()<br />print l<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />a = (1,2,3)<br />a.sort()<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Guys who attended please post more gotchas if you bumped into them .<br /><br /><br />Next up ankur started a tallk on pycharm - a python ide.<br />The key benefit of pycharm is that it allows you to do lot of stuff from the editor itself like git commands , starting django projects and so on .<br /><br />personally i am sold on emacs and the benefit it gives that you can do everything from the keyboard itself and need to touch the mouse very very few times , the shortcuts , macros , programmability of emacs is truly amazing .<br />i also need to start trying vim as i have heard it gives emacs a run for its money :)<br /><br />In the breaktime ankur was also telling us about cool products from thinklabs that enable kids to learn ----- hold your breath ----- Robotics !!!<br />I found this incredible and super impressive work is being done by thinklabs .<br /><br />Next up was the talk that blew me away and probably everyone else too.<br /><br />Martin came up on the floor and spoke about how to be better programmers . Martin has 30 years programming experience . yes 30 years :)<br /><br />He is 67 years of age but looks 37 and really fit .<br /><br />Key points from martin were that we should accept programming is a high stress , long hours (at times) job.<br /><br />So we should take generous vacations , time off and get away from our desks for outdoor cool activities &nbsp;- biking , swimming , soccer , yoga , tai chi , climb mountains .<br /><br />Also Reading is really a key task all programmers should imbibe . without any reading we are all quite useless irrespective of our talents , smarts .<br /><br />Martin said that to build real stuff &nbsp;we need to work effectively in teams and so we need knowledge about high level stuff of software engineering after being cool with the programming language (python !!!)<br /><br />He recommended a book list to learn such stuff :<br />clean code<br />clean coder<br />refactoring<br />dont make me think<br />design of everyday things<br />Test driven development<br />Code complete<br />pragmatic programmer<br />Design patterns by gang of 4<br />Implementation patterns<br />(if you have read &nbsp;one from above - you can give a talk during <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/198264570352594/">next mumpy</a> !!!)<br />I will add few links to the above post soon ...<br /><br /><br />Next event -<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/591478720893326/"> Barcamp on coming sunday 29th september</a><br /><br />cheers to all programmers . Happy coding<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
